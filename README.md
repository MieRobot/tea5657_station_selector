# tea5657_station_selector
   This example was based on the TEA5767 library published by Marcos R. Oliveira at: https://github.com/mroger/TEA5767. I am using the same library with different example code.
   
   My code allows changing between preset number of stations. There are stored in the station array as frequencies. There are two buttons connected to the Arduino. A station selector button to D3, which tunes into the next station in the array. The other button connectioned to D2 is a mute/unmute button which implements a soft mute of the TEA5767 chip.
   Set your serial monitor to 9600 baud to see status messages.
